# Software Development lifecycle

|    SDLC Purpose    |

- Devs know what they are trying to make
- Managers can track progress
- track if product meets requirements

|      Benefits      |


- A common vocabulary for each step
- Defined communication channels between development teams and stakeholders
- Clear roles and responsibilities among developers, designers, business analysts, and project managers
- Clearly-defined inputs and outputs from one step to the next
- A deterministic “definition of done” that can be used to confirm whether a step is truly complete


|       Process      |

VALNAV TEAM
-------------
1. **Planning**
    - Resource allocation (both human and materials)
    - Capacity planning
    - Project scheduling
    - Cost estimation
    - Provisioning

    ***Output***
    - project plans
    - schedules
    - cost estimations
    - procurement requirements 
    
2. **Design and Prototype**
    - Design patterns
    - architecture frameworks (for code reuse and standardization)
    - rapid prototyping (optional)

3. **Develop**
     (Agile --> Time boxed Sprints)  (Waterfall --> single block of effort)
    - Features
    - Bug fixes
    - engage with stakeholders, ensure expectations being met

    ***Output*** 
    - testable, functional software
    
4. **Testing**
    - code quality
    - Unit Testing
    - Integration testingperformance testing
    - security testing
    - QA testing
    - Can use continuous integration tools to ensure tests are run regularly and never skipped.

    ***Output***
    - functional software, ready to deploy to production environment

5. **Deployment**
    - idealiy highly automated
    - Application Release Automation (ARA) systems are usually integrated with Continuous Integration tools. 
    
    ***Output***
    - release to Production of working software.

6. **Operations and maintenance**
 - constant monitoring to ensure proper operation
 - error reporting send bugs back
 - improvment requests 


An abbreviated process is necessary to ensure that the fix does not introduce other problems (known as a regression.)
    - Regression testing (rarely non-regression testing[1]) is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that
        previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.[2] If not, that would be called a regression
